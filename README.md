# Luke Bransby's Portfolio

## [Project: MRI Brain Segmentation via Gaussian Mixture ModelsMotivation](https://github.com/lbransby1/mri-em-Segmentation)
* Initiated a self-directed project to master the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by engineering a custom implementation from scratch in Python/NumPy.
* Application: Applied the algorithm to T1-weighted MRI scans to solve a real-world medical segmentation problem (separating Grey Matter, White Matter, and CSF).
* Outcome: Successfully resolved the "Lindley's Paradox" conflict between statistical metrics ($k=2$) and biological accuracy ($k=5$) using Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) analysis.

## [Dashboard Project: MMA Metrics](https://github.com/lbransby1/MMAMetrics)
* Dashboard to view ensemble predictions for Mixed Martial Arts Outcomes for fights
* Fighter Comparison with radar charts and dynamic metric comparisons between fighters
* Fully Optimised models with Optuna
* Swap Ensemble Averaging to eliminate corner bias
* Fully deployed [Here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lukebransby/MMAMetrics) on Hugging Face Spaces for public demo

## [Research Project: Implementing NLP techinques to predict UFC Matches](https://github.com/lbransby1/Final-Year-Project)
* Final Year dissertation at QMUL - recieved A grade
* Predictive performance increased by 6% over using exclusively numeric features
* Implemented Principle Component Analysis to reduce components for efficient predictions
* Produced a Full research report with methodology, results and analysis
